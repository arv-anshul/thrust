# ü¶Ä The Rust

I have learned Python programming language and now I am learning Rust programming language to understand low-level concepts like Stack, Heap, Ownership & Borrowing (specific to Rust), different data-types (`u8`-`u128`, `i8`-`i128`, `char`, ...), etc.

During my learning I am practicing and creating some programs. For example, I've built "Stone, Paper, Scissor" game and also written a small cooridantes system program in Rust.

I'am learing Rust using only free resources (available on internet) from YouTube videos, Rust Books and ChatBots ([Phind.com](https://phind.com), [perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai)).

## üóÇÔ∏è Showcase

1. [`hand_game`](src/bin/hand_game.rs): The "Stone, Paper, Scissor" Game
   - Uses `Enum`, `Struct`, `Result`, `match` statements, `while` loop, functions.
   - Uses `rand` dependency to generate random numbers.

```bash
cargo run --bin hand_game
```

2. [`coordinates`](src/bin/coordinates.rs): Co-ordinate System program
   - Uses `Sruct`, `impl`, implement operators (`Add`, `Sub`).
   - Implement `fmt::Display` for `Point` struct.
   - Written methods like `euclidean_distance`, `is_collinear`, etc.
   - This is not a game or any CLI program. You can learn from reading the code.

```bash
cargo run --bin coordinates
```
